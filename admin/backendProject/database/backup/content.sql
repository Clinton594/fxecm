Cryptocurrency made the leap from being an academic concept to (virtual) reality with the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. While Bitcoin attracted a growing following in subsequent years, it captured significant investor and media attention in April 2013 when it peaked at a record $266 per bitcoin after surging 10-fold in the preceding two months. Bitcoin sported a market value of over $2 billion at its peak, but a 50% plunge shortly thereafter sparked a raging debate about the future of cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular.</font></p><p style=\"outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.6em; color: rgb(86, 88, 114); font-size: 15px;\"><font face=\"tahoma\">When entering the world of cryptocurrency investing the first thing veterans and newcomers alike have to deal with is the vast amount of information available. This is no different than the situation in any other investment vehicles, be it stocks, bonds, commodities or forex, to name just a few.</font></p><p style=\"outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.6em; color: rgb(86, 88, 114); font-size: 15px;\"><font face=\"tahoma\">The difficult part is separating the good from the bad, the unbiased truth from the wishful thinking of uninformed participants of the crypto space (and there are a lot of those around). Company websites, roadmaps, countless videos of self-proclaimed gurus, well-intentioned but poorly informed enthusiasts, the outright shill machines and con artists are nothing but a hindrance when trying to conduct proper cryptocurrency analysis.</font></p><p style=\"outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.6em; color: rgb(86, 88, 114); font-size: 15px;\"><font face=\"tahoma\">In the world of crypto investment, it is not enough to just join a few Telegrams or Twitter groups, watch a few YouTube videos and read an article here and there to make a buying decision. A more focused approach is needed. To this end, finding the correct sources of information and commentary needs to be complemented with the aid of massive amounts of data, preferably sorted in a way that makes its analysis straightforward.</font></p><p style=\"outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; line-height: 1.6em; color: rgb(86, 88, 114); font-size: 15px;\"><font face=\"tahoma\">A tool providing useful information like market caps, coin supply, trading volumes, etc., is a good start.

Learning how to invest wisely and patiently over a lifetime can yield returns that far outpace the most modest income. Nearly every member of the Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans made the list in 2019 because they owned a large block of shares in a public or private corporation.

In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver, naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and also as mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium.</font></p><p style=\"outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.6em; color: rgb(86, 88, 114); font-size: 15px;\"><font face=\"tahoma\">Imagine yourself sitting in a stream swirling water in a pan, desperately hoping to see a small yellow glint of gold and dreaming of striking it rich.

In fact, early paper currencies were generally backed by gold, with every printed bill corresponding to an amount of gold held in a vault somewhere for which it could, technically, be exchanged (this rarely happened). This approach to paper money lasted well into the 20th century. Nowadays, modern currencies are largely fiat currencies, so the link between gold and paper money has long been broken. However, people still love the yellow metal.</font></p><p style=\"outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.6em; color: rgb(86, 88, 114); font-size: 15px;\"><font face=\"tahoma\">&nbsp;</font></p><p style=\"outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.6em; color: rgb(86, 88, 114); font-size: 15px;\"><span style=\"outline: none; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font face=\"tahoma\">How is the price of gold determined?</font></span></p><p style=\"outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; margin-bottom: 15px; line-height: 1.6em; color: rgb(86, 88, 114); font-size: 15px;\"><font face=\"tahoma\">Gold is a commodity that trades based on supply and demand. The interplay between supply and demand ultimately determines what the spot price of gold is at any given time. The demand for jewelry is fairly constant, though economic downturns do, obviously, lead to some temporary reductions in demand from this industry. The demand from investors, including central banks, however, tends to inversely track the economy and investor sentiment.
